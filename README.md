# password-generator

For this assignment I was tasked to allow a user to imput different sets of characters and then generate a random and secure password from those paramaters.  The password may contain upper case, lower case, numbers, or special characters and can be between 8 and 128 characters.  The focus was to understand how javaScript can manipulate and change static HTML pages.
